The project objective was to create a honeypot for a SSH connection. The connection opens on the *ip* and *port*. The honeypot also logs a timestamp for the connection made. The user must install paramiko using the terminal. After installing paramiko the user can copy and paste the code. The user must have two windows when using the code. One code is for the honey itself and the other the client for a test. Also, the IP address and port can be changed to your liking. This honeypot is a simple build yet logs when itâ€™s connected to. The log also keeps track of the IP and the port being used by the connecting user. Simple yet effective. 


Run the script with Honeypot with time and date logger.py
The default file for the connections to be logged is honeypot_log.txt
